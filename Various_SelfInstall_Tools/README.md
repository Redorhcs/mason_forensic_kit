## AccessData FTK Imager
[Forensic Toolkit, or FTK, is a computer forensics software made by AccessData. It scans a hard drive looking for various information.[1] It can, for example, locate deleted emails[2] and scan a disk for text strings to use them as a password dictionary to crack encryption.[3]

The toolkit also includes a standalone disk imaging program called FTK Imager. The FTK Imager is a simple but concise tool. It saves an image of a hard disk in one file or in segments that may be later on reconstructed. It calculates MD5 hash values and confirms the integrity of the data before closing the files. The result is an image file(s) that can be saved in several formats, including DD raw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_Toolkit)

## Autopsy

[Graphical version of TSK. Sleuth Kit is a freeware tool designed to perform analysis on imaged and live systems. Autopsy is used as a graphical user interface to Sleuth Kit. Autopsy provides case management, image integrity, keyword searching, and other automated operations. Since the package is open source it inherits the security principles which all open source projects benefit from, namely that anybody can look at the code and discover any malicious intent on the part of the programmers. Autopsy  runs on a TCP port; hence several students can connect to the server and work on a case simultaneously. Autopsy and Sleuth Kit included the following product features](https://sites.google.com/site/incidentresponsedetective/outside-reading/autopsy-vs-ftk)

## HashCalc

[A fast and easy-to-use calculator that allows to compute message digests, checksums and HMACs for files, as well as for text and hex strings.](http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/)

## HxD

[HxD is a hex editor, disk editor, and memory editor developed by Maël Hörz for Windows. It can open files larger than 4 GiB and open and edit the raw contents of disk drives, as well as display and edit the memory used by running processes. Among other features, it can calculate various checksums, compare files, or shred files](http://mh-nexus.de/hxd)

## Volatility

[The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools,
implemented in Python under the GNU General Public License, for the
extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.
The extraction techniques are performed completely independent of the
system being investigated but offer visibilty into the runtime state
of the system. The framework is intended to introduce people to the
techniques and complexities associated with extracting digital artifacts
from volatile memory samples and provide a platform for further work into
this exciting area of research.](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility)

## WinPrefetchView

[Each time that you run an application in your system, a Prefetch file which contains information about the files loaded by the application is created by Windows operating system. The information in the Prefetch file is used for optimizing the loading time of the application in the next time that you run it. 
WinPrefetchView is a small utility that reads the Prefetch files stored in your system and displays the information stored in them. By looking in these files, you can learn which files every application is using, and which files are loaded on Windows boot. ](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/win_prefetch_view.html)

## Elex
[Event Log Explorer is an effective software solution for viewing, analyzing and monitoring events recorded in Microsoft Windows event logs. Event Log Explorer greatly simplifies and speeds up the analysis of event logs (security, application, system, setup, directory service, DNS and others).

Event Log Explorer extends the standard Windows Event Viewer functionality and brings many new features. Users who tried Event Log Explorer see it as a superior solution to Windows Event Viewer helping to boost their productivity twice.](https://www.eventlogxp.com/)

## MailView
[Viewer for standalone files containing Microsoft Outlook Express 4,5 and 6 message database (*.idx/*.mbx/*.dbx), Windows Vista Mail/Windows Live Mail and Mozilla Thunderbird message databases as well as standalone EML files. This application is based on MiTeC Outlook Express Reader and MiTeC Thunderbird Reader. It displays list of contained messages with all needed properties as ordinary e-mail client. Message can be viewed in detailed view including attachments (save ability) and HTML preview. It has powerful searching and filtering capability and also allows to extract all email address from all emails in opened folder to list by one click. Selected messages can be saved to *.eml files with or without their attachments. Attachments can be extracted from selected messages by one command. Of course, opened messages can be printed including images.](http://www.mitec.cz/mailview.html)
